# Netflix Movie Poster Database

This is a part of a collaborative project between myself and [Michael Parish](https://github.com/MikeParish).
This repository houses movie poster images for our Netflix API which uses this repo as an HTTP endpoint.
The main repo is an [Vue app utlizing an Azure API](https://github.com/MikeParish/summer_stream) which can be found on Michael Parish's Github account.
